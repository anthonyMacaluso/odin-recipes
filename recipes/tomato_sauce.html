<h1>Tomato Sauce</h1>
<img src="../images/sauce.jpg">
<h2>Molto Macaluso's famous (but not actually famous) tomato sauce</h2>
<p>This is my recipe for the tomato sauce I make for my family.</p>
<p>This sauce works well on pretty much any pasta, but works exceptionally well for spaghetti and meatballs.</p>
<p>Always use a high quality extra virgin olive oil, unseasoned canned DOP san marzano tomatoes, and fresh basil.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 28 oz cans San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>3-4 Cloves Garlic chopped small</li>
    <li>Small Sweet or Yellow Onion diced</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil (to taste)</li>
    <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    <li>Fresh Ground Pepper</li>
    <li>Sugar (to taste)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a stainless-steel pot (get that teflon oudda here), add 1 tbs extra virgin olive oil, set heat to low/medium.</li>
    <li>After a few minutes, add onion and simmer until tender (we aren't looking to clarify at this stage).</li>
    <li>Add garlic and continue to simmer.  Add more olive oil if needed.</li>
    <li>Add a few dashes of salt and fresh ground pepper</li>
    <li>Before garlic browns, pour in tomatoes.  Don't worry about breaking up the tomatoes yet, the cooking process will soften and break them down.</li>
    <li>Cover and let sauce simmer over low heat for 3-4 hours, stirring occassionally</li>
    <li>At this stage, your sauce is almost ready and we can add 5-6 fresh basil leaves.  Taste and add salt/sugar/pepper to your desire.  If you cooked meatballs as well (and you should), add them to the sauce and simmer for another 30m - 1hr.</li>
    <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
